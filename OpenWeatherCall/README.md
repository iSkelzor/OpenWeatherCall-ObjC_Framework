# OpenWeatherObjectiveC-Framework
Framework for working with the free weather-data from openweathermap.com - written in Objective-C.

OpenWeatherMap is a project for collecting weatherdata and give them to all for research, fun or other purpose.
I used this data by myself for my little app-project Growing Grass.

With this little Framework you can experiment with actual and historic weather data (all what I needed) and, if you want, expand it for making Weathermaps etc.
